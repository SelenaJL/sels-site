  text: 'Being involved in the greater tech community, especially with youth, is incredibly inspiring and fulfilling. \
  My goal is to be the role model I wish I had growing up when I was instead told that women didn\'t belong in this field. \
  Through mentorship and public speaking, I\'m able to change that narrative and the programs below have given me that opportunity. \
  I\'m forever grateful for the work they do to empower the people of today to shape the world of tomorrow.',
